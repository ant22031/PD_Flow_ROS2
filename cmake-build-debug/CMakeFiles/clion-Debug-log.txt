CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0146 is not set: The FindCUDA module is removed.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0146" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenNI.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OpenNI", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenNI" with any
  of the following names:

    OpenNIConfig.cmake
    openni-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenNI" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenNI_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "OpenNI"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
